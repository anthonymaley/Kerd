# TODO

## Now

**Next: the push-wiring design conversation** — the ladder's first work item sits at the design gate (`docs/product/push-wiring.md`; the gate names contract's needs: `docs/design/push-wiring.md` + a GO record). Drawn package, two-key GO, then contract → build of the staleness-refuser slice. Session record: `kivna/sessions/2026-08-04.md`. Remaining design-layer builds after it: grounding-was-read · gate.py rendering through the progress view. Working default: per-piece evidence check before each transformation — no blanket license.

Debt carried: `Frame the intent` route-specific acceptance checklists; one `(?)` left on the board (Design: machine-checkable interface values); cache pinned at kerd/0.70.0, seven versions behind (repin when convenient).

## Backlog

*Ranked by the function 5 axes — consequence x value. See `docs/plans/2026-08-03-choose-what-matters-view.excalidraw`.*

**High consequence**
- **CI on `~/3of3`** — *3of3 is its own project, not part of Kerd* (clarified 2026-08-04); a possible trial ground for the refusal pattern, taken up only if that project wants it. `/loop` still cannot run there until something refuses.
- Repin `leru`, `krutho-strategy`, `krutho-founders` off `kerd/0.65.0` — high consequence, **no value**: pure hygiene, one cache GC from silent breakage. `obair` has no pin at all (deliberate, or drift — unchecked).

**Medium**
- Clean krutho-strategy's stray `sessions-of-record/` — unblocked by the mode cut (v0.75.0).
- AGENTS.md needs its own verdict: gitignored, machine-local, stale Codex-era fork (`.Codex-plugin`, `/kerd:dian` references); its identity line was fixed locally in the cut, the rest of the drift stands.
- Regenerate the choose-what-matters view before its next use: Bree item removed, and candidate cards must carry no skill names (`gen_choose.py`).
- Hook version staleness check in `/kerd:tend` — four occurrences now.
- Guard switch-in step 3 smoke test against context bloat (delegate the run; absorb a verdict, never a full log).

**Low — genuinely ignorable, and you can see what ignoring costs**
- README conductor section's closing line "Conductor doesn't touch git. No pulls, no pushes." contradicts the commits-its-own-work paragraph above it — stale since v0.67.0. One-line fix, next release that touches the section.
- Decide whether switch should commit the vault repo (contract vs behaviour disagree).
- `CHANGELOG.md` stale at 0.14.0 while the repo is at 0.68.0, and absent from the release checklist. Revive or delete.
- Surface model-tiered delegation in the two plugin capability-list descriptions. Open since v0.64.0.
- Stale `Kerd.md` MOC version field (says 0.31.0) — update per release or remove (lean remove).
- Consider promoting the refined question-formation rule from the pair hook into global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

**Blocked — not candidates at any consequence**
- skriv voice profile wiring — needs non-founder-genre samples.
