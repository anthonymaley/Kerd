# TODO

## Now

**2026-08-23 midday — `funnel-driver` unparked, its mechanism changed to an
umbrella above conductor, two design views sealed.** See
`kivna/sessions/2026-08-23.md`.

**Where things stand**

- **`funnel-driver` sits at design.** Frame rewritten, killer risk retired by
  construction, slices re-cut. Two views sealed (`fp:54f84887b8b8`,
  `fp:47883502cf4b`).
- **`gate-visuals` still sits at goal** — untouched today.
- **Register: 38 live, 33 approved, 0 invalidated** — unchanged.

**Next, in order**

1. **`docs/design/funnel-driver.md` + its GO record** — the only two things
   between the item and contract. The frame is currently carrying design-level
   detail because that is where the conversation landed; the design doc has to
   separate out what the frame does not say — what the umbrella *is* (skill or
   command), how it calls conductor without requiring it to change, where the
   question file lives and its format, and how the completeness check reads it.
2. **Name the umbrella.** `/kerd:product` is the standing recommendation under
   the currency rule; `concert` is refused as an invented name. Tony's call, and
   it blocks the design doc's vocabulary.
3. **Then slice 2: one gate's question set**, hand-written, used once for real.
   No template system, no shape inference, no second gate.
4. **The `gate-visuals` goal gate** — cold eyes, then the expert-user pass. Its
   `Product measurements met` row has no upstream declaration; write the gap
   honestly rather than inventing a target after the fact.
5. **Frame the measurement item** — Tony's value statement is captured verbatim
   in CONTEXT.md and nothing is framed yet. It sits *behind* the diagram work
   under his own ordering (diagrams first, numbers second).
6. **The four kept items from the standards spike** — 25010 → `R-0011`'s quality
   column · 24774 §5.3 header on every `SKILL.md` · the UI viewpoint as a build ·
   the spine sentence in `docs/design/gate-visuals.md`.
7. **The archaeology batches** — 53 candidates in
   `docs/requirements/archaeology.md`. C-06 against R-0051, C-24 against R-0028
   are yours.
8. **Retire the old register** — `docs/requirements/findings.md` §9. One ruling:
   does the reqview validator graduate into `gate.py audit` first?
9. **The suspect-link stamp has no slot in the format** — a format change.

**Open, from today, not yet rows:** does re-agreeing a lapsed approval cost
anything? If coming back means re-walking the gate, early gates must not lock at
all. Untested — recorded in the frame as an open question.

**The reset's three questions stay open** — what the requirements system IS, the
draft to final, build-vs-adopt (`docs/kerd-interview.md`).

**Still parked by the reset, not cancelled:** closing `model-effort-advisory` and
`hooks-autoload` on the ladder. Do not walk these by hand.

## Backlog

*Ranked by consequence x value. See `docs/plans/2026-08-03-choose-what-matters-view.excalidraw`.*

**High consequence**

- **Standards grounding — second pass.** The spike (`docs/product/standards-grounding.md`,
  findings at `docs/design/standards-grounding-findings.md`) left three
  surfaced and unread: **ISO/IEC/IEEE 82079-1** (writing instructions — what
  a `SKILL.md` step body is, by 24774 §5.2), **ISO/IEC 25040** (the SQuaRE
  evaluation *process*, which `tools/design/` reinvented), **ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748**
  (life-cycle stages — the `stage:` field and the rung ladder, misfiled under
  product on his map). And 29148 never got the 42010 term-mapping test.
- **The conductor marker cannot carry a sitting's open time, and 2026-08-23 is
  the second and worse instance — the diagnosis is now broader than "planning
  twice".** First bite (2026-08-22): re-entering `plan` overwrote the `execute`
  stamp. Second bite (2026-08-23): the session ran ~08:44–12:17 almost entirely
  in `plan` — a design conversation carried by drawings — so `execute` stamped
  at **12:17**, fourteen minutes before close. Handing that over as the sitting's
  open time would have labelled a four-hour session as fourteen minutes. **The
  real defect: the marker holds one line, so it can only ever report the LAST
  phase, while the open time is a property of the FIRST.** Any design-heavy
  session reproduces this, planning once or twice. Two candidate fixes, neither
  chosen: keep a separate never-overwritten `opened` stamp, or have the boundary
  derive the open side from the session's first machine-written timestamp rather
  than from the marker at all. Owner: conductor's mode-marker section + switch's
  sitting-heading rule.

- ~~**Verify hooks auto-load fires on this machine.**~~ **CLOSED 2026-08-13
  ~16:40**, at this sitting's switch-in. Three confirming observations: the
  cache carries 0.96.0 with `hooks/hooks.json`; neither `.claude/settings.local.json`
  nor `~/.claude/settings.json` holds any Kerd hook wiring; and `📋 Last session:
  2026-08-13` appeared at session start — a string built only by
  `hooks/session-start.sh` (lines 39, 58, 63). Auto-load works and
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves at runtime with zero per-repo wiring.
  **Note for `docs/product/hooks-autoload.md`:** its risk ledger still calls
  this open, and its acceptance test quotes the rendered string `Last session`
  when the source literal is lowercase — a grep for the documented string
  returns nothing and reads as "the hook didn't fire".
- **`gate.py --root` — the CLI half shipped 2026-08-14 (7 fixtures).** What is
  left: the hooks and skills that *invoke* the tools still assume the Kerd
  tree; nothing in a consuming repo calls `--root` yet. Narrowed, not closed.
- **Hookify — promoted to a dependency.** `OPS-001` (funnel interaction requires
  a conductor session, everything else stays open) is a **refusal**, and skill
  text cannot enforce it on itself. A hook fires outside the model, which is the
  only layer that can. `hookify` is installed and unused. Its
  `conversation-analyzer` also reads a transcript for behaviours worth
  preventing — the superpowers pull is one, since the v0.77.0 "tie is cut"
  countermeasure aims one layer below the cause.
- **Requirement archaeology over CONTEXT.md's 74 standing decisions.** Framed
  work, never ad-hoc, and **never from session logs** (see the decision in
  CONTEXT.md). Provenance must be marked permanently or the register becomes
  untrustworthy with no way back.
- **The release-planning artifact.** Gained two inputs today: project type ==
  release type for the twelve that ship, and `TECH-006` requirement dependency —
  which is the missing artifact behind the 2026-08-03 decision's first deciding
  factor, *"dependency forbids (hard constraint)"*.
- **Frame switch-fidelity slice 2 — capture human input.** Gaps 10/11/12. Note
  the overlap: requirements-traceability is arguably this slice's mechanism.
- **The fidelity check** (accepted unknown; review trigger already fired).
  Nothing verifies a pickup restored what the close recorded. It proves *file*
  reachability, never *finding* reachability.
- **boundary-cycle, in-half** — the reset ritual's automation. Killer
  feasibility question first, verified against harness docs at frame.
- **Plugin cache repin debt.** Reopened by v0.95.0: the cache was current at
  0.94.0 this afternoon and the repo has since shipped. Structural — the only
  session running current cache text is one where nothing shipped. (Narrowed by
  v0.96.0: this is now about stale *skill text* only — hooks no longer rot with
  the cache version, they auto-load and resolve `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` at runtime.)
- **Stashes and local-equals-remote are unchecked at the boundary.**
- **The playbook's `## Current Status` duplicates CONTEXT.md.** Its stale
  content was fixed this session (v0.90.0 → v0.95.0, three hooks → four); the
  duplication itself remains. Kill it or make it a pointer.
- **Out-of-repo artifacts have no home** — PRs, URLs, decks, external docs.
- **Stop-hook over-prescription**: distinguish work-dirty from
  session-state-dirty at a real stopping point.

**Medium**

- **The refusal surface does not travel with the plugin — the return condition
  FIRED 2026-08-07.** It was accepted "for now" with the trigger *"the first
  time Kerd's ladder is run in a repo that isn't Kerd"*; declaring requirements
  traceability a capability for consuming projects is that moment. Now
  interlocked with the `--root` row above.
- **`docs/vault-spec.md` contradicts itself** (found by tend this session): line
  39 says Weekly is "the one append-style file in the vault", line 88 describes
  the decisions file as accumulating entries. `Kerd Architecture Decisions.md`
  (6 dated sections) and `Kerd Skill Lessons.md` (5) sit in the gap. Not drift —
  a genuine unresolved rule.
- **`Kerd.md` MOC has one broken wikilink** — `[[eloas/Eolas]]`, a typo for
  `eolas`. 16 of 17 resolve. Vault write, so kivna's.
- **Revisit the journey view when more data exists** (parked 2026-08-05, shape
  agreed on mock v4).
- Clean krutho-strategy's stray `sessions-of-record/`.
- AGENTS.md needs its own verdict: gitignored, machine-local, stale Codex-era fork.
- Regenerate the choose-what-matters view before its next use.
- Hook version staleness check in `/kerd:tend`.
- PR-event edge in the stale CI step (unexercised; no PR flow).
- Guard switch-in step 3 smoke test against context bloat.
- **lorg-cut candidate** — evidence check per the rip discipline before any
  license. **Interrogate rides the same review** — and note it now has a second
  caller: requirement qualification is the same shape as risk qualification.
- **kivna verdict** — same zero-usage smell as the vault; import/export
  confirmed unused.
- **CI rule for the single-definition law** — nothing machine-enforces
  "conductor never re-describes a Switch Out step".
- **Close-out double-write** — conductor step 1 writes CONTEXT/TODO, step 6's
  invoked flow overwrites both.
- Derive the rigor refusal messages from `RIGOR_LEVELS` via join.
- Gate records can only say GO: a refused gate has no dated home.

**Low — genuinely ignorable, and you can see what ignoring costs**

- `CHANGELOG.md` stale at 0.14.0 while the repo is at 0.95.0, and absent from
  the release checklist. Revive or delete.
- Stale `Kerd.md` MOC version field (says 0.31.0).
- Consider promoting the refined question-formation rule from the pair hook into
  global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

**Blocked — not candidates at any consequence**

- skriv voice profile wiring — needs non-founder-genre samples.
